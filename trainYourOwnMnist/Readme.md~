# Train mnist using your own images

## Introduction

In [tensorflow.org](http://www.tensorflow.org) there are [MNIST For ML Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html) and [Deep MNIST for Experts](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.html) for learning. 

In these tutorials, the training source is from [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). It is awesome, containing thousands of images.

But there are some situations that we want to use our own images for training. I have searched on the Internet and could hardly find the direct way to convert images into MNIST Database format. So I just do it myself and have found another way to create my data files and train it in the tensorflow.

## Method
###Step One

You should first have some images for training. You can use your own images or use [my images](https://github.com/LinShiwei/TensorflowLearning/tree/master/trainOurOwnMnist/numberImage) for a try. 

The images like the following, should have a black background and a white number.

###Step Two

I have writed some Matlab code to convert your images into image data and create label data. These data are in binary format and have `.txt` suffix. Here shows the data format in these data file.

After generating, these four files should like the following:
```
trainImage.txt
trainImageLabel.txt
testImage.txt
testImageLabel.txt
```
And then you should use [gzipCreate.py](https://github.com/LinShiwei/TensorflowLearning/blob/master/trainOurOwnMnist/gzipCreate.py) to convert these files into '.gz' files.
```
trainImage.txt.gz
trainImageLabel.txt.gz
testImage.txt.gz
testImageLabel.txt.gz
```
Until now, the training files are ready.(training files can be find in this repository)

###Step Three

I have done some changes to tensorflow's mnist example code. You can use `lswBeginnerMnist.py` for simple mnist training or use `lswDeepMnist.py` for deep mnist training.

Result of [lswBeginnerMnist.py](https://github.com/LinShiwei/TensorflowLearning/blob/master/trainOurOwnMnist/lswbeginnerMnist.py) training , 29 images.

Result of [lswDeepMnist.py](https://github.com/LinShiwei/TensorflowLearning/blob/master/trainOurOwnMnist/lswDeepMnist.py) training , 36 images.
